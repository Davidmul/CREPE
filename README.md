CREPE - Cosmic Ray Electron Propogation codE

At the moment this code is very focused on the needs of the author.
Planning to make it more user friendly in time so it can used by wider community.

To do:
- Delete unneeded sections  
- Tidy
- Courant conditions work properly
- inputs are via a parset --> done but needs refinement
- adaptive length
- Energy dependence can be switched on
